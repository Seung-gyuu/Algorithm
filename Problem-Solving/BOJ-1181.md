## DESC
Given several words, you need to:

- First line of output = the number of words(N).

- Remove duplicates.

- Sort the words by length in ascending order.

- If two words have the same length, sort them alphabetically.

- Constraint: N ≤ 50.

---

## Concepts

- sort() — sorts the existing list in place and returns None.

- sorted() — returns a new sorted list without modifying the original.

- set() — removes duplicate elements.
---


## Solution 
```python
# first nu = num of input
n = int(input())
words = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
# sort by length and alphabetically
words = sorted(set(words), key=lambda x : (len(x), x))
print(" ".join(words))
```
