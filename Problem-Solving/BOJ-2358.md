## DESC
Problem
There are 
𝑛
n points on a plane. Write a program to find how many straight lines pass through two or more of these points and are parallel to the x-axis or y-axis.

Input

The first line contains 
𝑛
n 
(
1
≤
𝑛
≤
100,000
)
(1≤n≤100,000).

The next 
𝑛
n lines each contain the coordinates of a point.

The same coordinates may be given more than once, but in such cases, they are considered distinct points.

Coordinates are integers with an absolute value less than 
2
31
2 
31
 .

Output
Print a single integer — the number of lines that pass through at least two points and are parallel to the x-axis or y-axis.

## Concepts

- map(int, input().split()) — Takes the list of strings returned by input().split() and converts each element to an int.

- dict.get(key, default)  — Returns the value for key if key exists in the dict.
If key does not exist, it returns the default value instead.

## Solution 1
```python
def solution():
    n = int(input())

    #(0,0)  → {0: 1}
    x, y = {}, {}
    count_x, count_y = 0, 0


    for _ in range(n):
        a,b = map(int, input().split())
        x[a] = x.get(a, 0) + 1
        y[b] = y.get(b, 0) + 1


    count_x = sum(1 for i in x.values() if i >= 2)
    count_y = sum(1 for i in y.values() if i >= 2)

    print(count_x + count_y)
```


## Solution 2
```python
from collections import Counter
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

x_list = []
y_list = []

for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x_list.append(x)
    y_list.append(y)

x_counter = Counter(x_list)
y_counter = Counter(y_list)

count = 0

for v in x_counter.values():
    if v > 1:
        count += 1

for v in y_counter.values():
    if v > 1:
        count += 1

print(count)
```
