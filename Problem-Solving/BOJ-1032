## DESC
Given several file names, you need to create a pattern where:
- Characters that are the same across all file names stay the same.
- Characters that differ are replaced with `?`.
- N <= 50

---

## Time Complexity
- n: number of files (≤ 50)
- m: length of filename (≤ 50)
- **O(n × m)**

---

## Solution 1
```python
def solution():
    # line 1: number of files
    # line 2 - N: file names
    # solve: output pattern (letters, ., ?)

    n = int(input())
    
    if n == 1:
        print(input())
    else:
        names = [input() for _ in range(n)]  		
        pattern = ""

        for i in range(len(names[0])):
            ch = names[0][i]
            for j in range(1, n):
                if ch != names[j][i]:
                    ch = "?"
                    break
            pattern += ch

        print(pattern)

```

## Solution 2
```python
def solution_optimized():
    num = int(input())
    word = list(input())
    for _ in range(num - 1):
        word_2 = input()
        for i in range(len(word)):
            if word[i] != word_2[i]:
                word[i] = '?'
    print(''.join(word))
```
